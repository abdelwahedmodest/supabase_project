If you receive a pull request (PR) from a programmer but you do not want to merge it, you can take the following steps to reject it on GitHub:

### Steps to Reject a Pull Request:

1. **Review the Pull Request**:
   - Navigate to the **"Pull Requests"** section of your repository.
   - Click on the specific PR you want to reject.
   - Review the code changes, comments, and commits to make sure you fully understand the reasoning behind your decision to reject.

2. **Leave a Comment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Before rejecting the PR, you can leave a comment explaining why you are not accepting the changes. This encourages transparency and fosters collaboration. Some reasons might include:
     - The code does not align with the project goals.
     - There are issues in the code that need to be addressed.
     - The features are not needed or already exist in another form.
   - Be constructive and professional when giving feedback.

3. **Close the Pull Request**:
   - On the PR page, there is an option to **"Close pull request"** at the bottom of the page.
   - When you click this button, the pull request will be closed without merging.

### Alternative Actions:

- **Request Changes**: If the pull request has potential but needs revisions, you can request changes rather than outright rejecting it. Use the "Request changes" option when reviewing the PR, and give detailed feedback for what needs to be done.
  
- **Reopen Later**: If you think the pull request might be useful in the future, you can always reopen it by navigating back to the closed PR and clicking **"Reopen pull request."**

By closing the pull request and optionally explaining why, you can reject the code contribution without merging it into your main branch.
